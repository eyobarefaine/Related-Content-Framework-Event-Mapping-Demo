# Related-Content-Framework-Event-Mapping-Demo
This repository contains the application designer project used to demonstrate how to leverage the event mapping component of the Related Content Framework. We extend the capability of the delivered PeopleSoft application without the need to directly and/or extensively modify delivered definitions.
# Instructions
- Download the FM_EVENT_MAPPING_DEMO folder to your desired location
- Import the project file through application designer
- Once successfully imported, you need to add the FM_ALLIANCE_DEMO component to the SCC_PROFILE_FL menu (this is optional). You will need to set up the appropriate security for the  associated CREF.
> **Note:** This project was created with PeopleTools 8.57.09. It has been tested to work with PeopleTools 8.58.03 as well.
